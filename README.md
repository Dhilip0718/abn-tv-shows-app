## Architecture Decisions

This project was built using Vue.js due to their simplicity, reactivity system, and ease of integration. Vue.js provides a component-based architecture that makes it easy to manage the UI, and Vuex helps manage the state in a predictable way.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed - v21.6.2
- NPM (Node Package Manager) installed - 10.2.4
